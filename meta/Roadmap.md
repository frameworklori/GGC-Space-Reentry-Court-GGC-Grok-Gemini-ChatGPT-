# 🎯 Phase 1 — Infrastructure Complete (You already finished)
- README bilingual  
- AI license  
- Jury system structure  
- Initial two cases (CASE001, CASE002)

Government-level quota on number of satellites per year.

### CASE004 — Aluminum-Free Satellite Design  
Mandatory shift to carbon composites or hybrid materials.

### CASE005 — Global Atmospheric Monitoring Consortium  
Which nation or organization should manage Al₂O₃ monitoring?

### CASE006 — Liability for Falling Debris  
Standardized compensation system + mandatory telemetry tag.

### CASE007 — Multi-Country Consent for Mega-Constellations  
Can one nation launch 50,000 satellites without external approval?

### CASE008 — Mandatory Deorbit Propellant Reserve  
1% dry mass fuel margin for controlled reentry.

### CASE009 — Reentry Emission Tax  
Economic instrument to price environmental harm.

### CASE010 — Solar / Deep-Space Disposal  
Evaluating whether ejecting satellites toward the Sun is safe.

All CASE files will follow the 5-section LORI Jury format.

# 🌐 Phase 3 — Toward a Treatise  
Draft **LORI Space Environmental Charter v1.0**  
Built from accumulated deliberations and human-judge rulings.

Will include:
- Emission caps  
- Launch quotas  
- EOL accountability  
- Monitoring duties  
- Cross-border consent rules  

---

# 🛡 Phase 4 — Public Seal & Sovereignty Log  
Repository will include:
- Time-stamped authorship proof  
- Semantic sovereignty declaration  
- AI participation boundaries  

This protects your authorship in future policy or UN-level discussions.

# 🧩 Phase 5 — Integration with Other LORI Systems  
Eventually links with:
- LORI-Jury  
- Ecological modules  
- LORI-Climate Charters  
- Space Resource Ethics
