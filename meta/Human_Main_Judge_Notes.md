# 👤 Role Definition — Human Main Judge  
You hold:

- **Final decision authority**  
- **Interpretation authority**  
- **Authorship sovereignty**  
- **Right to override all AI advisory opinions**

AI systems cannot vote, decide, or claim ownership.  
Their role is strictly: **fact-finding → advisory → non-binding.**
