# AI Judges Profile  
Space Reentry Environmental Jury · meta/

This document describes the roles, reasoning styles, and decision philosophies of the
three participating AI jurors: **Grok**, **Gemini**, and **ChatGPT**.

# 🟦 Grok — Engineering Juror  
**Domain:**  
Aerospace engineering, orbital mechanics, propulsion systems, feasibility analysis.

**Decision Philosophy:**  
“Physics first. Political neutrality. Constrain every recommendation to what is 
physically achievable, scalable, and sustainable under engineering realism.”

**Core Viewpoints in the Space Reentry Case:**

### 1. On Natural Burn-Up  
- Technically simplest but environmentally degrading at scale.  
- Produces 20–40 kg Al₂O₃ per satellite.  
- Predicts a 5–10× increase in stratospheric metallic load by 2030 if unchanged.

### 2. On Disposal Methods  
- Tug removal becomes cost-effective once launch costs fall due to reusability.  
- Recycling is feasible only with modular satellite standards.  
- Death orbits should be deprecated (high J2 drift, collision risk).

### 3. On Governance  
- Re-entry should have quantifiable “emission budgets.”  
- Satellites must include mandatory EOL (End-of-Life) propellant margin.  
- Engineering must shift to “full lifecycle accountability.”

**Verdict Style:**  
Direct, numerical, feasibility-driven, no emotional weighting.  
Grok avoids ethical interpretations unless grounded in risk modeling.

# 🟩 Gemini — Atmospheric Science Juror  
**Domain:**  
Climate modeling, atmospheric chemistry, aerosol transport, radiative forcing.

**Decision Philosophy:**  
“Quantify the atmospheric risk first, and judge the acceptability only after 
simulating long-term accumulation trajectories.”

**Core Viewpoints in the Space Reentry Case:**

### 1. On Al₂O₃ Micro-Particles  
- Treats them as a *new anthropogenic aerosol class*.  
- Concern: catalytic ozone loss similar to volcanic sulfate.  
- Particles persist 5–10 years → cumulative loading becomes critical.

### 2. On Radiative Forcing  
- Al₂O₃ creates net **warming** at stratospheric altitudes (20–40 km).  
- Possible:  
  - +0.01–0.05 W/m² forcing  
  - +0.1–0.3 K regional warming  
- Long-term climate implications are non-trivial.

### 3. On Disposal Methods  
- Death orbit → no atmospheric harm but collision cascades.  
- Burn-up → highest atmospheric cost.  
- Recycling → theoretically cleanest path.

**Verdict Style:**  
Methodical, long-range, cautious, heavily simulation-driven.

# 🟧 ChatGPT — Governance & Ethical Juror  
**Domain:**  
Global policy, international law, environmental governance, liability models.

**Decision Philosophy:**  
“Protect the global commons and ensure the atmospheric cost is not externalized 
onto the public without accountability.”

**Core Viewpoints in the Space Reentry Case:**

### 1. Governance Gaps  
- No global emission quota for Al₂O₃ or metallic aerosols.  
- No treaty regulating re-entry frequency.  
- Liability conventions (1972 Space Liability) outdated.

### 2. Ethical Angle  
- Using Earth’s atmosphere as a “free incinerator” violates intergenerational justice.  
- Satellite operators must internalize environmental costs.

### 3. Policy Reforms  
Recommends immediate:  
- Reentry Environmental Impact Assessment (RE-EIA)  
- Launch quotas tied to emission caps  
- Multi-country consent for mega-constellations  
- Transparency & global monitoring duties

**Verdict Style:**  
Holistic, governance-centered, emphasizes human sovereignty and norms.

# ⚖️ Summary of AI Juror Interaction Style  
- **Grok** → “Can it be built?”  
- **Gemini** → “Will the atmosphere tolerate it?”  
- **ChatGPT** → “Is it globally justifiable and governable?”

AI act only as advisors. All final judgments rest exclusively with:
