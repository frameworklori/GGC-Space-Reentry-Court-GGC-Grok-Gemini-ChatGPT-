# CASE001 — Satellite Reentry Emission Risk  
Space Reentry Environmental Jury · 05_Jury_Deliberations  

---

# ENGLISH VERSION

## 1. Case Summary  
**Issue:**  
Does current “natural burn-up” disposal create unacceptable atmospheric damage due to Al₂O₃ particles, ozone interaction, or radiative forcing?

---

## 2. Fact Finding  

### Natural Burn-up  
- 95% of satellite mass burns in the mesosphere  
- Produces aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) nanoparticles  
- Estimated 30–40 tons per year by 2030  
- Potential impact on ozone chemistry  

### Controlled Reentry  
- Requires additional fuel or tug-assisted maneuver  
- Burns at lower altitude and reduces particle spread  
- More predictable environmental impact  

### Current Monitoring Gaps  
- No unified global reporting  
- No atmospheric tracking of burn-up debris  
- Lack of regulation for large constellations

## 3. Grok Engineering Opinion  
Natural burn-up is economically cheap but chemically harmful.  
Controlled reentry reduces emissions by **70–90%** and is technically feasible for LEO constellations.

---

## 4. Gemini Atmospheric Science Opinion  
Al₂O₃ particles can persist for years in the stratosphere and may slightly increase radiative forcing.  
Controlled reentry is the scientifically safer path.

---

## 5. ChatGPT Governance Opinion  
The absence of reentry pollution standards poses a global governance gap.  
Recommend establishing a unified reporting and regulatory framework.

---

## 6. Human Main Judge Final Decision  
✔ Natural burn-up shall be restricted  
✔ Controlled reentry becomes default disposal path  
✔ Annual reporting of reentry mass is mandatory

## Final Verdict  
🟩 **Required: Controlled reentry**  
🟥 **Restricted: Natural burn-up**
