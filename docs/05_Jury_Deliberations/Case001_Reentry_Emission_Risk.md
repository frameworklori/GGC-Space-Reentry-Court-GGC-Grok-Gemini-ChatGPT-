## 1. Case Summary 案件摘要  
Issue:  
Does current satellite “natural burn-up” disposal create unacceptable atmospheric damage through Al₂O₃ particles, ozone depletion, and radiative forcing?

爭點：  
目前「自然燒蝕再入」是否造成不可接受的大氣污染（氧化鋁、臭氧層破壞、輻射平衡）。

---

# 2. Fact Finding（事實整理）

### ✔ Confirmed Scientific Facts  
- A typical 250–300 kg LEO satellite generates **20–40 kg of Al₂O₃** during burn-up.  
- Al₂O₃ particles (30–100 nm) persist **5–10 years** in the stratosphere.  
- Accelerates ozone loss via heterogeneous catalytic reactions.  
- Radiative forcing estimated at **0.01–0.05 W/m²** at 20–30 km altitude.  
- Annual re-entry count > **1,000 satellites**, accelerating to > **5,000/year by 2030**.  
- No binding global limit on re-entry emissions.

# 3. AI Juror Opinions

## 🟦 Grok — Engineering Juror Opinion  
**Conclusion:** Current burn-up is *efficient but harmful at scale.*

### Engineering Key Points  
- Natural burn-up is cheap and fuel-efficient (20–50 m/s delta-v).  
- But mass-production of Al₂O₃ becomes unavoidable with thousands of annual re-entries.  
- Active removal (tugs) can reduce emissions by **70–90%**.  
- Engineering feasibility for tug fleets by 2030 is high due to reusable rockets.  
- Failure to shift disposal method → atmospheric loading increases by 5–10x.

**Grok Verdict:** Burn-up is no longer sustainable after 2028–2030 traffic levels.

## 🟩 Gemini — Atmospheric Science Juror Opinion  
**Conclusion:** Atmospheric risk is *already non-trivial* and becoming *significant*.

### Key Atmospheric Points  
- Al₂O₃ absorbs solar radiation → stratospheric warming.  
- Enhances ozone depletion similar to volcanic aerosols.  
- Accumulates faster than natural removal.  
- Polar vortex effects magnify regional damage.

**Gemini Verdict:** The current burn-up model is environmentally unsafe long-term.

## 🟧 ChatGPT — Governance & Ethics Juror Opinion  
**Conclusion:** Governance gaps pose global risk.

### Governance Points  
- No international quota on re-entry mass.  
- No required reporting of Al₂O₃ loads.  
- No compensation mechanism for atmospheric harm.  
- No requirement for mitigation (tugs, targeted descent).

**ChatGPT Verdict:**  
This is a classic “global commons tragedy”—requires urgent policy correction.

# 5. Recommended Remedies 建議補救措施  
- Establish global Al₂O₃ annual emission cap.  
- Create mandated EOL (end-of-life) removal plans.  
- Launch licensing tied to RE-EIA (Reentry Environmental Impact Assessment).  
- Incentives for clean materials (carbon composites).  
- International monitoring through shared satellites.
