## 1. Case Summary 案件摘要  
Issue:  
For large constellations, which disposal path is more sustainable?  
- (A) High-orbit “death orbit” storage  
- (B) Natural burn-up  
- (C) Tug-assisted controlled removal  
- (D) On-orbit disassembly & recycling

爭點：  
大型星鏈衞星退役後，哪一種處理方式最環保且可持續？

# 2. Fact Finding（事實整理）

### Disposal Path Comparison  
| Method | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|------|
| Death Orbit | avoids immediate pollution | high long-term collision risk; unstable due to J2 |
| Burn-Up | cheap & simple | Al₂O₃ pollution, debris risk |
| Tug Removal | low pollution, safe | higher cost |
| Recycling | maximizes material reuse | requires modular design; tech immature |

# 3. AI Juror Opinions

## 🟦 Grok — Engineering Opinion  
**Verdict:** Tug-assisted removal + partial recycling is optimal by 2030.

### Engineering Points  
- Death orbits decay unpredictably (1–2 km/year drift).  
- Tugs workable at **$5M/sat** for large fleets.  
- On-orbit recycling possible if satellites follow modular standards (TRL 4–5).  
- Hybrid strategy: tug → ocean corridor → selected parts recycled.

---

## 🟩 Gemini — Atmospheric Science Opinion  
**Verdict:** Anything that reduces burn-up frequency reduces atmospheric loading.

### Atmospheric Points  
- Burn-up should be “last resort.”  
- Death orbits pose no atmospheric risk but long-term cascade danger.  
- Recycling eliminates re-entry entirely → best for atmospheric safety.

---

## 🟧 ChatGPT — Governance Opinion  
**Verdict:** Governance must support hybrid models with strict reporting.

### Governance Points  
- Operators must choose a disposal mode BEFORE launch.  
- Death orbit must require 100-year stability certification.  
- Recycling requires multinational docking standard.  
- Tug removal should be subsidized to encourage compliance.

# 5. Recommended Remedies  
- Set global satellite modularity standards.  
- Create “Space Recycling Zones” in LEO.  
- Mandate docking fixtures for future satellites.  
- Global fund to offset tug removal costs for developing countries.
