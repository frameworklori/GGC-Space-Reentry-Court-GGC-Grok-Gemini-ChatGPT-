## 1. Why Re-entry Charges?  
為什麼需要「再入排放費」？

Because each satellite produces ~30 kg of Al₂O₃ + metallic aerosols that:
- alter radiative forcing  
- damage ozone chemistry  
- persist 5–10 years  
- accumulate over time  

Every re-entry creates **global atmospheric damage**, yet operators currently pay **zero**.

現行制度中污染 = 免費。

# 2. Gemini Atmospheric Quantification  
### Annual Al₂O₃ Load  
- Current: ~30,000 kg/year  
- Projected: 300,000 kg/year (with megaconstellations)  

### Damage Scaling  
- Radiative forcing cost  
- Ozone depletion cost  
- Long-term climate persistence  

Gemini 結論：排放費可量化、可評估、可課徵。

工程陪審員：Grok

### Engineering Inputs  
A pricing model must consider:
- mass of Al-containing components  
- altitude of burn-up  
- completeness of ablation  
- surviving fragments  
- burn-up telemetry logs  

### Proposed Calculation Formula
