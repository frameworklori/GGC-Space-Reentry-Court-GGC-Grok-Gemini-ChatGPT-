# Global Space Environmental Fund  
全球太空環境基金（GSEF）  
Space Reentry Environmental Jury · 03_Compensation_and_Liability

---

## 1. Purpose 宗旨  
To ensure that environmental damage from satellite re-entry is not borne by the public, this fund allocates financial responsibility to satellite operators.

目標：讓污染者負擔污染成本，而非全球人民。

# 2. Gemini Atmospheric Assessment  
### Why a Fund Is Needed  
- Al₂O₃ persists for years  
- Climate impact lasts beyond single events  
- Monitoring requires international infrastructure (LIDAR, balloons, orbiters)  

Gemini 結論：大氣監測成本高，必須由使用軌道者支付。

# 3. Grok Engineering Assessment  
工程陪審員：Grok

### What Costs Should Be Covered  
- Atmospheric monitoring  
- Build-out of detection systems  
- Tug-assisted removal missions  
- R&D for low-emission satellite materials  
- Compensation for debris impact  

### Engineering Note  
Funds could directly subsidize:
- orbital tugs  
- recycling modules  
- green-material satellite design  

工程結論：基金能推動技術改善。

# 4. ChatGPT Governance Assessment  
治理陪審員：ChatGPT

### Operational Structure  
Recommended model:
- Mandatory contribution for every launched satellite  
- Variable fees based on:
  - mass  
  - material composition  
  - orbital altitude  
  - re-entry pathway  
- Annual public reporting  
- Managed by international environmental body  

### Ethical Basis  
- Fairness: users of orbit pay for damage  
- Prevention: incentivizes clean design  
- Responsibility: aligns with LORI ethical principles  

治理結論：基金必須立法化，成為國際規範。
